# About Me
Greetings! My name is Ruisheng Zhang (张瑞升), currently finishing my second year as a master in _Design_ from the [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.seu.edu.cn/jx_en/) at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/). **<font color=red>I am actively seeking a PhD position for 2025 Fall.</font>** Currently, I am a member of the Advanced Human-Computer Interaction Lab in the Industrial Design Department, under the supervision of [Associate Professor Xiaozhou Zhou](https://me.seu.edu.cn/zxz1/list.htm). From 2018 to 2022, I pursued my Bachelor's degree in _Mechanical Engineering_ from the School of Mechanical Engineering at Southeast University.

## Research Interests
I am really passionate about developing advanced algorithms and methods to solve real-world problems and improve user experience in interactions between users and machines/computers.  My research interests span a wide range of areas, including but not limited to: 
- **HCI research about pervasive computing and VR/AR**
- **Multi-modal intelligent user interfaces and intention-driven implicit interactions**
- **Ergonomic studies utilizing various types of sensors**

<!-- ## Research Interests
I am really passionate about developing advanced algorithms and methods to solve real-world problems and improve user experience, because it is incredibly rewarding to utilize noval technology to improve and enhance humans' lives. My research interests focus on **HCI research about pervasive computing and VR/AR**, especially in:
- **developing interactive devices for XR environments**
- **designing multi-modal user interfaces**
- **enhancing HCI user experiences with data-driven deep learning methods**. 

Additionally, I am also interested in **improving text input for XR scenarios**. -->

## Academic Skills
Currently, I possess proficient skills in **developing VR and AR applications using the Unity3D engine and C# programming language**. Additionally, I am adept at **developing neural networks using the Pytorch deep learning framework and Python**. Moreover, I have knowledge of fundamental psychological experimental design methods, data analysis techniques such as SPSS, visualization techniques such as Matplotlib. Furthermore, as a Master’s student in design, I am also familiar with collaborative design processes using Figma. The following outlines my specific skills:
- **Programming:** C#, Python, C++, Lua
- **Languages:** Chinese, English
- **Software:** Unity, Figma, Blender, Soildworks, SPSS, E-Prime, OpenCV, OpenGL
- **Device:** Oculus Quest 2, Varjo XR-3, HTC VIVE Cosmos, Microsoft HoloLens
- **Sensor:** Leap Motion (Hand Gesture), Tobii (Eye Tracker), Kinect360 (Motion Tracker)
- **Tools:** Machine Learning & Data Process (PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy), XR Development (Oculus Intergration, SteamVR, MRTK)
