## Title
Hierarchical Intention Recognition Framework in Intelligent Human‒Computer Interactions

## Abstract
Intention recognition is the prerequisite and foundation for achieving intelligent human‒computer interaction (IHCI). In complex task scenarios, human intentions often exhibit hierarchical and context-related characteristics. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical intention recognition framework suitable for complex tasks, aiming to infer multilevel intentions from the lowest-level data such as human behaviour, machine and environmental information. The framework's usability was validated via a case study of helicopter and drone collaborative wildfire rescue missions. First, task analysis was employed to extract the intention structure among high-level task intentions, low-level interaction intentions, and feature data. Flight simulation data from 80 complete trials conducted by 16 participants were subsequently collected. Finally, reliable recognition of interaction intentions and task intentions was achieved via a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) + bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural networks and a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). The highest recognition accuracies for interaction intentions and task intentions were 94.57% and 97.33%, respectively. The methods and results of this study provide a novel perspective for human intention recognition in complex tasks and offer methodological guidance and support for intelligent adaptive interfaces and IHCI in complex task scenarios.
