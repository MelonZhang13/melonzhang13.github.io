## Several Theories on the Influencing Factors of VR Motion Sickness
### 1. Sensory Conflict Theory (感觉冲突理论)
This theory suggests that VR motion sickness is caused by a mismatch between sensory inputs, particularly between visual and vestibular systems. When the visual system detects motion (e.g., through a moving VR environment), but the vestibular system does not sense corresponding motion (e.g., through the inner ear), this sensory conflict leads to symptoms of motion sickness.
### 2. Postural Instability Theory (姿态不稳定理论)
According to this theory, motion sickness arises due to the lack of physical body movement during VR interactions. When a person perceives movement in the VR world without physical motion, it can lead to disorientation and discomfort, which contributes to motion sickness.
### 3. Visual-vestibular Mismatch Hypothesis (视觉-前庭不匹配假设)
This hypothesis is based on the premise that discrepancies between visual input (such as the display of motion in VR) and the lack of corresponding vestibular stimuli (such as the absence of physical motion) lead to a disruption in the perception of balance, causing motion sickness.
### 4. Optokinetic Nystagmus (OKN) Hypothesis (眼球震颤假设)
This theory posits that the rapid eye movements caused by visual stimuli in VR can lead to motion sickness. When users are exposed to certain visual patterns or stimuli that induce optokinetic nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye movements), it can result in discomfort or nausea in some individuals.
